# Pack One mobile release configuration

Updated 2026-09-24.

Pack One uses Expo SDK and Expo Prebuild as React Native tooling, but **does not require Expo Application Services (EAS), an Expo account, or an Expo project ID** to build or release the app.

## Production identity

The production identifier is fixed and source-controlled:

- iOS bundle identifier: `pro.packone.app`
- Android application ID: `pro.packone.app`
- App Store Connect app ID: `6814318676`
- App Store SKU: `packone-ios-001`
- App name: **Pack One**

Development and preview native builds use non-store identifiers so they can coexist with the production app:

- development: `pro.packone.development`
- preview: `pro.packone.preview`

The `packone://` custom URL scheme remains unchanged for the current native auth handoff.

## Native generation and local builds

Expo's native tooling can generate the native projects locally:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
PACKONE_BUILD_PROFILE=production npx expo prebuild --clean
```

After prebuild, the generated `ios/` and `android/` projects can be built with Xcode / Android Studio or Expo's local run commands. No EAS project linkage is required.

Development examples:

```bash
PACKONE_BUILD_PROFILE=development npx expo run:ios
PACKONE_BUILD_PROFILE=development npx expo run:android
```

Production/release compilation requires the normal native platform prerequisites and signing material.

## Release checks

`npm test` validates development, preview, and production Expo config.

`npm run release:check` additionally verifies:

- production iOS identity remains `pro.packone.app`
- production Android identity remains `pro.packone.app`
- no EAS project ID is required
- the production P¹ icon exists

## Artwork

The current 1024×1024 P¹ release icon is committed at `mobile/assets/images/icon.png`.

Before store submission, inspect it on actual devices and in store-preview tooling. Platform-generated masking/cropping must not remove the P¹ mark.

## Signing / store access that remains external

These values are not committed to Git:

- Apple Developer signing certificates/profiles and Team access
- Android upload/signing key material
- Google Play Console application/service-account permissions

The verified Apple application record already exists. Google Play API access remains blocked until the existing service account is granted access to the Pack One application.

## Store listing URLs

- Marketing: `https://packone.pro/`
- Support/contact: `https://packone.pro/contact/`
- Privacy: `https://packone.pro/privacy/`
- Terms: `https://packone.pro/terms/`

## Intentionally deferred

- Sign in with Apple provider/capability work
- store billing/purchase/restore architecture
- verified Universal Links / Android App Links
- remote crash telemetry
